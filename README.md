# Surfs Up Weather Analysis
##Project Overview
Goal was to review weather patterns in Hawaii as we look to open a surf and ice cream shop. This project focused on the weather temperature in June and December, looking at different statistics between the two periods to help assess whether an ice cream/surf shop would have good weather conditions in which to operate.

##Results
The following tables summarize June's temperature statistics over time.

These two tables tell us about the differing weather patterns for the two monthly periods. Some takeaways:

Average temperature between June and December is 75 and 71 degrees respectively, show a moderate temperature and very little fluctuation between the two periods from an average standpoint.

The maximum temperatures of 85 (June) and 83 (December) are also very similar.

The minimum temperature of 56 (December) and 64 (June) show the greatest variance, and reflects a much lower temperature level in December that may not be conducive to ice cream or surfing. The standard deviations of 3.25 (June) and 3.74 (December) we would expect a little more variation in the december numbers.

Additional analysis of the precipitation in June and December provides better context to the conditions as well.

Here you can see the wetest instances of June through the periods of 2011 - 2017.
